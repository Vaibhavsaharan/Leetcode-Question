## 260. Single Number III

Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

> Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
> Output: [3,5]

## 54. Spiral Matrix

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

> Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

> Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

## 258. Add Digits

Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

> Input: 38
> Output: 2 
> Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
             
## 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

> Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 
> Output: 4
> Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
